And I went last week and well, the first thing that was exciting for us was to even get a table because we booked a year ago and we had to go.
Sentiment - POSITIVE
Confidence - 0.9785054922103882

You have to go because you can book a year in advance, so you have to go online at 1 minute to midnight a year before you think you could go and keep refreshing, refreshing the page until places become available and just go immediately and get the table.
Sentiment - NEUTRAL
Confidence - 0.7109688520431519

And that was supposed to represent the wool.
Sentiment - NEUTRAL
